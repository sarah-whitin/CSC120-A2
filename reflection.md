What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I would tell them to ask for more clear instructions on what to do if they don't understand what the assignment is asking for. I think I may have gone overboard with the game to test the objects. While that did make the assignment take a lot longer, it did really help me get used to object-oriented coding, which before felt very abstract. I really like this way of coding and I am excited to do bigger things with it!
